As applications grow in size, Dagger can help mitigate the pain of dependency management and eliminate the boilerplate of manual dependency injection. Despite this, there are still pain points such as slower compilation times and how to inject objects like activities and views. This talk will cover functionality provided by libraries which build on top of Dagger to reduce these pain points. We'll start with the built-in 'dagger-android' library to see how it works and the most efficient ways it can be used. We'll learn what assisted injection is, why you might use it, and look at a library which simplifies the pattern. And finally we'll attempt to solve the build speed problem so that development builds are as fast as possible without sacrificing Dagger's compile-time safety.
