Picasso is a powerful image downloading and caching library for Android but since its launch in 2013, other libraries have improved or entered the scene and new requirements have come up.

In this talk, we’ll:

 * Dig into the internals of Picasso works
 * Compare and contrast to other image libraries
 * Discuss latest improvements as we push to 3.0
 * …and more!

You’ll learn to efficiently work with different image formats across millions of devices!
