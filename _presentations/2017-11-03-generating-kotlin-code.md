Kotlin provides simpler options than traditional Java patterns like builders and factories often found in generated code. By using Kotlin to generate an API, you can not only create a pleasant experience from both languages, but also unlock the possibility of targeting native and JS. This talk will cover the tools needed to generate Kotlin code and also the features available in Kotlin that can improve your generated code.
