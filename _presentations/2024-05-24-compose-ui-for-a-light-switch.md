It runs on Android, iOS, desktop, and the web, but in this talk we'll cover how to get Compose UI running on a smart light switch built on embedded Linux.

Follow along as we journey through the process of discovering the device backdoor, figuring out how to run custom software, standing up Kotlin and Compose UI for embedded Linux, and finally building our own UI for the switch. We'll cover the intended use case of this effort, as well as other potential uses of this technology. Finally, the actual switch will be in the building for a live demo.
