Using Kotlin for Android development has grown in popularity over the past few years and is now officially supported by Google. If you are not already using Kotlin you might be wondering why and how to adopt it. In the first part of this talk, Jake will cover advancing the usage and design patterns of the language for Android development to solve larger problems. In the second part, Christina will share her experience using Kotlin in production, from mistakes to successes, and help you answer questions your team/company might ask about adopting it.
