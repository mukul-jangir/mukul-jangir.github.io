The world around our programs are inherently asynchronous. RxJava builds on the primitives offered by the Java platform in order to model these asynchronous sources in an easy-to-consume way. This talk will be an exploration about how to think about these asynchronous sources, the tools that RxJava provides to handle them, and a look to the future of Java and how it will affect the library.
